# House Price Prediction Project

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts house prices based on various features.
It includes a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model training, and a Python web application to serve the final prediction model.

### Key Features
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.
- **Model Training:** An XGBoost Regressor model is trained on the dataset to predict prices.
- **Web Application:** A simple web interface to input house features and receive a price prediction.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)
- XGBoost (for the prediction model)
- Joblib (for saving the model)
- Flask / Streamlit (for the web application)
